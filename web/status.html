                                <h1>New Features</h1>
                                <li>1/12/18: omfg, There is finally a currency system, which means the Item Shop has been rolled out.<br><br>There is even bug fixes and an actual fucking loading screen. <br><br>Oh shit, and the Empress Effects are done besides the items.
                                <Br>
                                    Speaking of items, thanks goes to paranoiaInsomnia for making caste items like this: <img height = "18" src="images/Items/jade.png"> and The Tormented contributed a SCIENCE TRIDENT.
                                </li><br>
                                <li>1/11/18: Grubs don't use the worse looking crawling bodies as their default portraits anymore. <br><Br>Working on shop shit. </li>
                                <li>1/10/18: Grubs can get bored of big dumb hug piles now and wander around occasionally.</li>
                                <li>1/9/18:  Simple, pointless playpen is available for you to shove your grubs into. Without any items to distract them it ends up turning into a giant grub pile p quickly. Oh well.<br><br> Next up is me getting a shop set up so you can buy items to shove in there and change your grub's stats.</li>
                                <li>12/31/17: The sim keeps track of who the current empress is, now.</li>
                                <li>12/29/17:  Mutant grubs have custom endings.<br><Br> You can get the save data string for your grubs/alumni, so you can use them in other places. <br><br> Pupated trolls who refuse to leave the caverns are now kicked out at the next graduation. Also: You can click <a href = 'goodbye.html'>Here</a> to kick them out manually.<br><br> Still working on playpen.</li>
                                <li>12/26/17: Been working on getting the playpen working (it's the biggest part of the planned features). In the meantime, finally enabled mutant blood trolls.</li>
                                <li>12/21/17: Pupated trolls are assigned a sign based on caste and highest aspect-stat, lunar sway is currently random.</li>
                                <li>12/20/17: Wigglers can die from things other than natural causes.</li>
                                <li>12/19/17: Wigglers have stats and the stats mildly effect the Epilogue with more effects planned.</li>
                                <br>
                                <h1>Known Bugs</h1>
                                <li>Renaming a wiggler right after it changes state (such as hatching) makes it revert to previous state. If you refresh, it's fixed.</li>
                                <li>Occasionally double clicking will give you twins of an egg. </li>
                                <br>

                                <h1>Expected Future Features: (shit is bare bones right now)</h1>
                                <li>loading screen for playpen.</li>

                                <li>each stat has custom fuscia possibilities</li>
                                <li>Food/Boredom Mechanic</li>
                                <li>current empress influences game play (odds of violent death, whether mutants are culled, etc</li>
                                <li>Simple "Alternia" object, all alumni influence it, but especially current empress. State of planet influences possible troll lives, availability of mutant eggs, and availability of features (cull button meaning kill or meaning 'give extra help' for the extremes). </li>
                                <li>rewards for achievements (like getting all signs in a caste)</li>
                                <li>Seriously sit down and try to fix my text wrap alg</li>
                                <li>random egg option (cheaper than other eggs, once currency)</li>
                                <li>pagination for adopts and alumni</li>
                                <li>stabilize save data. it corrupts sometimes. WHY???</li>
                                <li>Load grub from dataString</li>
                                <li>Play mini games with wigglers. (both existing and new ones. wigglers automatically populated into game)</li>
                                <li>Wiggler friendships. If two wigglers have a strong bond in the playpen diff interations, ((might be too hard, but, makes it into their epilogue in a tiny blurb???)) </li>
                                <li>vague genetics mechanic (big incestuous slurry (maybe you pick 10 alumni?) gets you a pile of traits (img layer values, palette color values, stats), new wiggler gets traits from all sources, with chance of mutation (including the highly visible ones like candy red). If all visible traits are from same troll, it's a descendant.
                                <li>Page where you can view grubs genetic source for each "gene" (only one layer deep though)</li>
                                <li>Filter alumni based on caste/sign/aspect/lunar sway.</li>
                                <li>mini games with alumni</li>
