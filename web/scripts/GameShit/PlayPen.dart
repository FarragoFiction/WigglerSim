TODO:

a play pen has a canvas it renders to, a list of wigglers inside it and their positions.
it also has a list of items in it and their positions.

only grubs can be in a playpen, nothing else.

How do I want to handle animation? seems a waste to give it to the Grub itself....

I think I'll make a wrapper object that has the grub itself, and an array of animation frames?
so the playpen doesn't have a list of wigglers, but a list of AnimatedWigglers???
