    soft thing, living thing, food thing, hard thing
    stats.
    when a grub interacts with it, it's stats will determine if they like it or not.

    the item does not interact back

    when buying an item, only unique slots for items with unique stats.
    i.e. tildeath book and skull (hypothetically) both show in same slot, randomly???
