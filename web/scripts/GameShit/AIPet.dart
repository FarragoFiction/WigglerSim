/*
    An ai pet has a pet inside of it, as well as a list of animations it can play. and an idea of when to play them.

    Use cases:
        Trigger: Pet has nothing better to do
            Action: idle animation (flip between two similar bodies)
        Trigger: Pet wants to investigate an object that is not near by.
            Action: Walk animation to object's x/y coordinates. (flip between two similar bodies, change x coordinates)
        Trigger: Pet wants to investigate an object close by.
            Action: display chosen emoticon or text (age based), idle animation as well
        Trigger: Pet wants to attack an object close by.
            Action: figure out some attack animation. play that. item removed from playpen by jadeblood.

    Now, I also need to figure out how stats are going to effect AI. I might need to use the debug_rambling page
    for some solid ideas. But I can probably get the idle animation started for now.
