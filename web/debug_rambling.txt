Alright.

I know what I want to do.

And there are a LOT of ways to do it.

Which one is right for my needs?

Doom/Life Calm/Energetic

Summary of Problem: (Five minutes on the Clock).

I want to take 6 stats, each of which could be positive or negative, and convert
that into a Begining, Middle, and End for the trolls.

If at all possible, I want to avoid randomness.

If at all possible, I want there to be a satisfying connection between Epilogue and stats.

SubProblems: I think it will be more complex than flags, because 12 possible stats.

((future jr, look into land theme stuff possibly for this, but no solution now).

What other parts of this problem exist?

I need to keep the text BRIEF, no risk of it going off screen.

Do I want lusii selection to be based on stats? Lusii actions?

Case of death. Yes. If they die younger than lifespan, it was a violent or sickly one.

I think each part of the problem needs to turn into sub problems, Begining, Middle, End.

I don't want to drill down too much into details right if I'm on the clock.

Think.

I anticipate that it will still LOOK somewhat random, unless I focus hard on making things work.

What about stat interactions? (the land idea from earlier???)?   An impatient, energetic wiggler vs a patient energetic wiggler?

I don't want this to be TOO involved, but I do want there to be a satisfying correlation.

There's that word again: satisfying. I want stats to mean something because the epilogue is the
last permanent thing you get for the wiggler. It has to be THEM, frozen in time.

Also: will raw stats matter or only pos vs neg? Thresholds?

Alright. Only 20 seconds left. That's good enough for time.

~~~~~~~~~~~

So, before I started summarizing the problem, I was tempted to try to roll a solution right now, with only
my single test stat added. I realize now that it will make me too dependant on independant stat values, which I don't want.

So:

Action Items:

*  Add 5 more stats.
* Stats have thresholds for low, medium, high, and VERY HIGH values. Don't print raw numbers any more.
    * Grubs are born with low/medium stats. High and VERY HIGH will be from raising.
*  Make a Begining Use case for how lusii and lusii actions will matter (maybe only actions?).

Possible thought: Pick two things for middle and begining based on highest and second highest abs value stats?

But then it would be too consistent.

Weight each stat based on comparison to VERY_HIGH, pick from array?
have begining, middle and end stored in stat itself. Remove stat from array if you pick it for a section, so you can't
spam it?

Would make creating the stat a bit more ponderous, but I don't mind. It's like the land thing wihtout
being as involved as the half-thought I had during problem definition.

Yes. This is my plan.  Stat has the thing that goes in the template when it says lusii did x and y and troll did x and y.
template itself is random.
b,m,e arrays, and copies for jade, fuscia, and purple

((Also, I'm realizing that by doing it this way (game play coded last, endings coded first),
I'm sort of giving people goals to work towards. First they see the endings, then they get
the tools to raise their wiggler towards desired endings and find new ones.


~~~~~~~~

Okay, I have some infrastructure in place.

I might not be able to think straight enough (shit is stressful irl) to do anything with teh infrastucture.

What needs to happen?

When I create a Stat, i should pass a positive and negative flavor.

That's first . I don't have to think more than that many steps ahead.

~~~~~~

Alright that's done.

What's the next step?

For each stat in the stats array, ask it to add whatever flavor is appropriate at the right weight to
a weighted array.

Then, add the default values at a low weight. .1 or whatever.

So. What is the right weight?

I want some things to essentially be zero weight, right?

Maybe not.

So, Use Case:

I have HIGH PATIENCE.

I ask the stat to add itself to my existing array of flavor text.

It says "my value is positive", so it uses positiveFlavor and not negativeFlavor

Then, it says "am I higher or equal to low?", the answer is "yes", so it adds all "low" values.
Then it says the same for medium, which is YES, high, which is YES and VERY HIGH which is "no".

So the only one it doesn't add is VERY HIGH. Weights it adds it at is based on which tier it is.

Now, since the DEFAULT flavor thing isn't attached to a stat, the stat itself can't have the logic.

The stat will pass a number to it and the "am I higher or equal to X" logic happens on the passed number.

If it's default, the number you pass in is the average abs value of all stats.
