Alright.

I know what I want to do.

And there are a LOT of ways to do it.

Which one is right for my needs?

Time/Space  Impatient/Patient
Doom/Life Calm/Energetic
Rage/Hope Realism/Idealism
Void/Light Accepting/Curious
Breath/Blood Free/Committed
Heart/Mind Introversion/Extroversion

Summary of Problem: (Five minutes on the Clock).

I want to take 6 stats, each of which could be positive or negative, and convert
that into a Begining, Middle, and End for the trolls.

If at all possible, I want to avoid randomness.

If at all possible, I want there to be a satisfying connection between Epilogue and stats.

SubProblems: I think it will be more complex than flags, because 12 possible stats.

((future jr, look into land theme stuff possibly for this, but no solution now).

What other parts of this problem exist?

I need to keep the text BRIEF, no risk of it going off screen.

Do I want lusii selection to be based on stats? Lusii actions?

Case of death. Yes. If they die younger than lifespan, it was a violent or sickly one.

I think each part of the problem needs to turn into sub problems, Begining, Middle, End.

I don't want to drill down too much into details right if I'm on the clock.

Think.

I anticipate that it will still LOOK somewhat random, unless I focus hard on making things work.

What about stat interactions? (the land idea from earlier???)?   An impatient, energetic wiggler vs a patient energetic wiggler?

I don't want this to be TOO involved, but I do want there to be a satisfying correlation.

There's that word again: satisfying. I want stats to mean something because the epilogue is the
last permanent thing you get for the wiggler. It has to be THEM, frozen in time.

Also: will raw stats matter or only pos vs neg? Thresholds?

Alright. Only 20 seconds left. That's good enough for time.

So, before I started summarizing the problem, I was tempted to try to roll a solution right now, with only
my single test stat added. I realize now that it will make me too dependant on independant stat values, which I don't want.

So:

Action Items:

*  Add 5 more stats.
* Stats have thresholds for low, medium, high, and VERY HIGH values. Don't print raw numbers any more.
    * Grubs are born with low/medium stats. High and VERY HIGH will be from raising.
*  Make a Begining Use case for how lusii and lusii actions will matter (maybe only actions?).

Possible thought: Pick two things for middle and begining based on highest and second highest abs value stats?

But then it would be too consistent.

Weight each stat based on comparison to VERY_HIGH, pick from array?
have begining, middle and end stored in stat itself. Remove stat from array if you pick it for a section, so you can't
spam it?

Would make creating the stat a bit more ponderous, but I don't mind. It's like the land thing wihtout
being as involved as the half-thought I had during problem definition.

Yes. This is my plan.  Stat has the thing that goes in the template when it says lusii did x and y and troll did x and y.
template itself is random.
b,m,e arrays, and copies for jade, fuscia, and purple

((Also, I'm realizing that by doing it this way (game play coded last, endings coded first),
I'm sort of giving people goals to work towards. First they see the endings, then they get
the tools to raise their wiggler towards desired endings and find new ones.
