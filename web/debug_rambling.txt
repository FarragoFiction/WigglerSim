Alright.

I know what I want to do.

And there are a LOT of ways to do it.

Which one is right for my needs?

Time/Space  Impatient/Patient
Doom/Life Calm/Energetic
Rage/Hope Realism/Idealism
Void/Light Accepting/Curious
Breath/Blood Free/Committed
Heart/Mind Introversion/Extroversion

Summary of Problem: (Five minutes on the Clock).

I want to take 6 stats, each of which could be positive or negative, and convert
that into a Begining, Middle, and End for the trolls.

If at all possible, I want to avoid randomness.

If at all possible, I want there to be a satisfying connection between Epilogue and stats.

SubProblems: I think it will be more complex than flags, because 12 possible stats.

((future jr, look into land theme stuff possibly for this, but no solution now).

What other parts of this problem exist?

I need to keep the text BRIEF, no risk of it going off screen.

Do I want lusii selection to be based on stats? Lusii actions?

Case of death. Yes. If they die younger than lifespan, it was a violent or sickly one.

I think each part of the problem needs to turn into sub problems, Begining, Middle, End.

I don't want to drill down too much into details right if I'm on the clock.

Think.

I anticipate that it will still LOOK somewhat random, unless I focus hard on making things work.

What about stat interactions? (the land idea from earlier???)?   An impatient, energetic wiggler vs a patient energetic wiggler?

I don't want this to be TOO involved, but I do want there to be a satisfying correlation.

There's that word again: satisfying. I want stats to mean something because the epilogue is the
last permanent thing you get for the wiggler. It has to be THEM, frozen in time.

Also: will raw stats matter or only pos vs neg? Thresholds?

Alright. Only 20 seconds left. That's good enough for time.

~~~~~~~~~~~

So, before I started summarizing the problem, I was tempted to try to roll a solution right now, with only
my single test stat added. I realize now that it will make me too dependant on independant stat values, which I don't want.

So:

Action Items:

*  Add 5 more stats.
* Stats have thresholds for low, medium, high, and VERY HIGH values. Don't print raw numbers any more.
    * Grubs are born with low/medium stats. High and VERY HIGH will be from raising.
*  Make a Begining Use case for how lusii and lusii actions will matter (maybe only actions?).

Possible thought: Pick two things for middle and begining based on highest and second highest abs value stats?

But then it would be too consistent.

Weight each stat based on comparison to VERY_HIGH, pick from array?
have begining, middle and end stored in stat itself. Remove stat from array if you pick it for a section, so you can't
spam it?

Would make creating the stat a bit more ponderous, but I don't mind. It's like the land thing wihtout
being as involved as the half-thought I had during problem definition.

Yes. This is my plan.  Stat has the thing that goes in the template when it says lusii did x and y and troll did x and y.
template itself is random.
b,m,e arrays, and copies for jade, fuscia, and purple

((Also, I'm realizing that by doing it this way (game play coded last, endings coded first),
I'm sort of giving people goals to work towards. First they see the endings, then they get
the tools to raise their wiggler towards desired endings and find new ones.


~~~~~~~~

Okay, I have some infrastructure in place.

I might not be able to think straight enough (shit is stressful irl) to do anything with teh infrastucture.

What needs to happen?

When I create a Stat, i should pass a positive and negative flavor.

That's first . I don't have to think more than that many steps ahead.

~~~~~~

Alright that's done.

What's the next step?

For each stat in the stats array, ask it to add whatever flavor is appropriate at the right weight to
a weighted array.

Then, add the default values at a low weight. .1 or whatever.

So. What is the right weight?

I want some things to essentially be zero weight, right?

Maybe not.

So, Use Case:

I have HIGH PATIENCE.

I ask the stat to add itself to my existing array of flavor text.

It says "my value is positive", so it uses positiveFlavor and not negativeFlavor

Then, it says "am I higher or equal to low?", the answer is "yes", so it adds all "low" values.
Then it says the same for medium, which is YES, high, which is YES and VERY HIGH which is "no".

So the only one it doesn't add is VERY HIGH. Weights it adds it at is based on which tier it is.

Now, since the DEFAULT flavor thing isn't attached to a stat, the stat itself can't have the logic.

The stat will pass a number to it and the "am I higher or equal to X" logic happens on the passed number.

If it's default, the number you pass in is the average abs value of all stats.

~~~

Alright, I think I have the infrastructure.

Now what needs to call it?

I guess I'll approach it from the opposite angle? I need to unhook old middle text and use this one instead.

Different templates.

~~~~~

Alright. It's not time for bed yet. So what's left?  Non-Natural causes of death of course.

What I need to do is have some stats marked as "increase chance of violent death". And some be neutral, and some case it.

Then add up stats and use that as a random roll for if they die early or not.

THEN pick a random number between 1 and their expected lifespand and that's their new lifespan.

THEN ask a stat what hte cause of death is. (random list???)

~~~~

Morning: Any stat? No only stats that increase chance of violent death..

What stats would that be?


    static StatFlavor defaultFlavor;
    static StatFlavor patienceFlavor;
    static StatFlavor energeticFlavor;
    static StatFlavor idealisticFlavor;
    static StatFlavor curiousFlavor;
    static StatFlavor loyalFlavor;
    static StatFlavor externalFlavor;
    static StatFlavor impatienceFlavor;
    static StatFlavor calmFlavor;
    static StatFlavor realisticFlavor;
    static StatFlavor acceptingFlavor;
    static StatFlavor freeFlavor;
    static StatFlavor internalFlavor;


    Things that reduce risk of early death:

    patient, calm, accepting  ((less because alternia was dangerous))

    things that increase rick of early death:

    , curious, impatient, idealistic,loyal,curious

    internal/external , energetic,realistic don't effect it either way?

    So what kind of endings do   curious, impatient, idealistic,loyal, free ,

    cause?

    "asking the wrong questions","trying to rise in the ranks too quickly", "fighting for their ideals","defending the Empire from rebels", "rebelling against the empire"


also special death text for Fuchsias (no others). Fuchsias are special cases in general, likely to die very early
violently.

~~~

alright, what do I need to do next?

I guess go at it from the other end, what is currently happening on death?

int lifeSpan =  rand.nextInt(max - min) + min;
        int numberOfSweeps = lifeSpan;


So, once I get the lifeSpan i should calculate if i die early
(dif alg for heiresses). If I do, pick a stat randomly from my list of
stats, weighted by comparison of that stat to high (and default is in there, too)

~~~
Now, how to do fuchsia?

Normally it will be "generate a number between 0 and 2x lifepsan, if it's lifepsan or longer, assume natural death"

but the heiresses have this HUGE chance of dying early, then less likely later on.

So. What?

assume max lifespan is "100*2". If it's 100 or bigger, they win their challenge?



~~~~~

Okay, time for the last thing I need to hook up, otherwise known as the biggest thing.

//based on stats
String getCauseOfDeath() {
    return "FIGURE THIS OUT ASSHOLE";
}


Alright so, loop on stats, for each stat, add the stat's flavor (it auto gets positive vs negative).

To add the flavor, loop on the stat's flavors death flavor, the weight you add it at is your stats percent thingy.

then, add default at .01 or whatever.

OR would it be better to try to add the weight at the stat flavor's weight?

how did I do regular middle text flavor anyways? i already fogotet

~~~~~~

oh shit, oh fuck, i forgot to weight shith by liklihood of violent death, like an asshole, it's just random

Also everything is a natural death righ tnow.


Alright.

So I have a method violentDeathString that takes in how long they lived and uses their stats to get "cause of death";

but i forgot to have the method that needs to call that.

It's just
String regularEnding(int maxLife) {
        //TODO
        throw("todo");
    }

For heiresses i just generated a random number between 5 and maxlifespan * 2 and that's
all well and good, they are special.

BUT, for regular trolls....what to do?

I know i have some infrastructure set up:

each statflavor takes in a poistive, negative or neutral number.

Do I still want it to work that way?

So let's get a usecase out:

Impatient: Low, so 1.0
Energetic: Medium
Idealistic: Medium, so 1.0
Accepting: Low so -3.0
Free-Spirited: Low, so 1.0
Internal: Low


I should probably multiply by weight in StatFlavor, so:

LOWWEIGHT = 0.5, MediumWeight = 1.0

1.0* 0.5 + 1.0 * 1.0 + -3.0*0.5 + 1.0 * 0.5

Total odds of a violent death = 0.5 + 1.0 - 1.5 + 0.5 = 0.5

So what do I do with this number?

generate random number between -1 and violent death chance (if negative death chance skip).

if number is positive, violent death?

OR, could separate it out a bit, cuz -1 was arbitrary.

instead of:
1.0* 0.5 + 1.0 * 1.0 + -3.0*0.5 + 1.0 * 0.5

arguments for = : 1.0* 0.5 + 1.0 * 1.0  + 1.0 * 0.5
arguments against = : -3.0*0.5

generate a number between -1.5 and 2.5.   If it's positive, violent death.

Yes, I like this.

~~~~~~~
Okay. Next thing that happens is me assigning signs.

Several things will need to happen.

ONE, I need to figure out what their highest normalizedStat is. (pick it at random between ties).

Then (for now) pick a lunar sway at random. LATER it will be based on the care you give them, maybe.

THEN I need to know how to associate all 288 signs.

Might wanna flat out make it an object system.

Like, have a caste object, and each caste has a owned lunar sway object and THAT has only 12 signs.

So, first I say "I am a bronze blood" and pass a random fucking lunar sway.

The bronze object goes to the chosen lunar sway and then asks the passed in troll
what it's highest stat is.   From there, it returns the img_num needed to render the right sign.

OR.....

Could approach this based on the object I already have.

Go through the stat directly.

Ask the troll "what's your highest stat, if more than one, pick one at random"
then, go to the stat itself and pass in lunar sway (random) and blood color word
and it knows how to turn that into a number.

that requires no new objects, but IS a bit less intuitive for distributing img numbers

With the other system I can just be store min and max numbers for castes,
with the stat based system it would be more:

huh. what WOULD it be?

on the extended zodiac grid it's diagonal.....

Actually...this is a good point.


I don't need to store just signs associated with a caste, i need to know
which is time+derse vs time + prospit.


Okay.   288 signs as specific objects?

Static variables that let me filter by caste, lunarsway and aspect.

THERE we go.

It will be a fucking chore setting them up. But. I can do it.


~~~~~~

Okay, I have 100% of burgundy set up. Before I get any further, it's time to experiment:

can i filter all signs by caste, aspect, moon?

And once I do, can i assign it to the troll and have it be rendered?

Just hard code the troll to be burgundy even if they aren't.

THEN, once I know it's hooked up, can procede to fill in other castes.

nvm, found  a helper. thanks 'I am cat.As yet, I am firerachet' -



~~~~~~~

Alright here we fucking go: time to brainstorm the actual AI.

    Stat patience;
    Stat energetic;
    Stat idealistic;
    Stat curious;
    Stat loyal;
    Stat external;

So, I want to come up with actions the wigglers can do,
and how the decision to take an action is mediated by their stats.

What do I have to work with?

I want there to be AI Pets and AIObjects? So that no matter what I'm interacting with
I can have the same code.

So Use Case.

A grub interacts with an AIObject.  The grub changes it's own state, and the
AIObject changes it's state (possibly not at all if it's inanimate).

Without trying to get too far into the code, let's try to imagine general things that the stats could be
related to.


Stat external;
    If it's high, they investigate their surroundings, if low, they space out.
Stat curious;
    This feels kind of similar to external/internal? Maybe it's how far they are willing to go to find new things?
    How likely they are to just walk around for no reason?
Stat energetic;
    How fast they move?
Stat patience;
    How long they interact with the same thing? (but how diff is this gonna be from loyal)

I'm noticing that plenty of stats seem similar when it comes to actions (but maybe not reactions).

So maybe...

Loyal/Patient = how long you interact with the same object
External/Curious = how far you're willing to walk to get to an object
Energetic/Idealistic = how fast you move (wide eyed wonder makes you fast?)


So what about reactions? Or maybe it'd be more accurate to call them interaction styles?
No, because loyal/patient invovle inveractions hrrrm....
